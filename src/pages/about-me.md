            <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Elena Domínguez</strong>, a passionate designer from Andalusia with a profound appreciation for design in all its forms 💡. 
            <p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve developed a broad skill set in multiple design disciplines, including <strong>fashion</strong>, <strong>graphic design</strong>, <strong>interior design </strong> and <strong>object design</strong>. This has made me a versatile and creative designer, equipped to approach every project from multiple angles.</p>

            <h3>Why Design?</h3>
            <p><strong>"I believe that a designer should never limit themselves to just one field. My love for design spans across graphic design, fashion, and product design. To truly excel, a designer must have a well-rounded understanding of various design areas, as it leads to creative, innovative, and functional solutions."</strong></p>
